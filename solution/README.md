## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- Azure Resources created with the script found in azureresources folder
- A SharePoint site made to the specifications found on the main README

## 📦 How to Clone and Pack the Power Apps Solution

### ✅ 1. Clone the GitHub Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/voltaire-toledo/FRKD_RHAIL-CDNavigator.git

### ✅ 2. Install Power Platform CLI
If you don’t have the CLI installed:
```bash
npm install -g @microsoft/powerplatform-cli
```

Verify installation:
```bash
pac --version
```

### ✅ 3. Pack the Solution
The unpacked solution files are already in this repo. To create a `.zip` file for import into Power Apps:

```bash
pac solution pack --folder ./solution --zipfile ./ClaimsDenialNavigator.zip --packagetype Unmanaged
```

**Notes:**
- `--folder` points to the folder containing the unpacked solution.
- `--zipfile` is the output file name.
- `--packagetype` can be `Unmanaged` or `Managed` depending on your need.

## Security Recommendations

### Objective
This section outlines key security practices for protecting Azure resources integrated with Microsoft Power Platform. It focuses on minimizing exposure to threats, securing sensitive services, and enabling monitoring for proactive threat detection.


To ensure a secure and resilient architecture when using services like Azure OpenAI and Azure Cognitive Search with Power Platform, follow these three core recommendations:

1. **Protect backend Azure resources** from public internet exposure using virtual networking and private endpoints.
2. **Implement content safety** mechanisms to guard against malicious inputs and model exploitation.
3. **Enable logging and diagnostics** to monitor activity and support threat investigations.


## Implementation Overview

### 1. Protect Backend Azure Resources
- **Objective**: Prevent direct exposure of Azure services to the public internet.
- **Actions**:
  - Secure Azure resources with a **Virtual Network (VNET)**.
  - Use **VNET subnet delegation** to connect Power Platform.
  - Expose Azure services to Power Platform via **Private Endpoints**.
- **Resources**:
